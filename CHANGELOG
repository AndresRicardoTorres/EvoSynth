=== 0.2.0

* added EvoBench module with following benchmarking features:
  * diversity calculations (distance, entropy and subsequence)
  * mean, median, variance calculations for array/population
  * t-test to determine statistical significance
  * Comparator, to compare the performance of two or more Evolvers

* export
  * evosynth has its own gnuplot class now, no need for a external gem anymore
    (removed dependency on gnuplot, gruff and rmagick gems)
  * moved exporter (console, csv, gnuplot) to Export module and directory

* various changes and improvements:
  * renamed Profile to Configuration!
  * refactoring of evolver - more flexible, now yields itself
  * Configuration and Logger constructors now yield themself, to make scoped block initialisation possible
  * refactored logging features: added DataFetcher and DataSet classes
  * removed unnessesary util function: create_console_logger (not needed anymore)
  * removed output module, moved logger to core and export to its own module (see above)
