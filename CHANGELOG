=== 0.2.0

* added SP_k problem to binary benchmark functions

* added EvoBench module with following benchmarking features:

  * diversity calculations (distance, entropy and subsequence)
  * mean, median, variance calculations for array/population
  * t-test to determine statistical significance
  * Comparator, to compare the performance of two or more Evolvers

* export

  * evosynth has its own gnuplot class now, no need for a external gem anymore
    (removed dependency on gnuplot, gruff and rmagick gems)
  * moved exporter (console, csv, gnuplot) to Export module and directory

* various changes and improvements:

  * added genome mixin, ArrayGenome and BinaryGenome include it

  * refactoring of profile:
    - renamed Profile to Configuration
    - constructor now yield self, to make scoped block initialisation possible
    - removed unnessesary util function: create_console_logger (not needed anymore)

  * refactoring of evolver:
    - moved Evolver into EvoSynth (core) module
    - constructor now yield self, to make scoped block initialisation possible
    - removed ConfigurationUsingEvolver and RunnableEvolver mixin's and merged code
      into Evolver
    - added a couple of functions, which need to be implemented by concrete evolvers

  * refactored logging features:
    - constructor now yield self, to make scoped block initialisation possible
    - added DataFetcher and DataSet classes
    - removed output module
    - moved logger to core and export to its own module (see above)
    - renamed #clear_data to #clear_data!
